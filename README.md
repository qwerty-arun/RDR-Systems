# RADAR Systems Programs in MATLAB

## 1. FMCW
- `Aim`: To detect the range of target using a FMCW radar system by simulating transmitter, receiver and beat signals in MATLAB.

## 2. CW Radar and Pulse Radar Systems
- `Aim`: To model a CW Radar to estimate the Doppler Shift and calculate target velocity and to implement pulse radar system to estimate the target range.
